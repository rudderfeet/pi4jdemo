# pi4jdemo

A simple Pi4J demonstrator using Spring Boot and Docker.

## Getting Started

This project is for Java developers who'd like to stretch out a bit and play
with "physical computing" using an inexpensive Raspberry Pi with many of the
tools they already know.  It's also a way to get practice with Spring Boot and
app containerization using Docker, again building upon a stable knowledge platform.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a Raspberry Pi configured to enable GPIO ports, some
circuitry to play with, and loaded with Java 8, Maven and Docker.  You'll
also need an Internet connection the first time you launch to allow
Maven to fetch its dependencies.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

There aren't a ton of unit tests to depend on, just the basics to test Spring's
context loader and a few easy spot checks.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [Spring Boot] (http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - IoC Framework
* [Docker] (https://www.docker.com/) - Container manager

## Acknowledgments

Sincere thanks to all the incredible engineers and hobbyists out there who've been
pushing the envelope on freely available, quality software over the decades. Without
their work on Linux and it's huge ecosystem of enabling software, and that of Java,
Maven and Spring developers, and of course the creators of the Raspberry Pi, a lowly
developer like me would have a much less fun world to play in.
